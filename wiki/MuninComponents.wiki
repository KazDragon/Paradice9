#summary A list of components and their behaviour

= Introduction =

The Munin library is comprised of a number of standard components.  This article documents them and their behaviour.

= Static Components =

Some components are static in that they have no special behaviours.  They just draw what they are told to draw.

== Filled Box ==

The filled box is the most basic component.  It takes up all the space given to it and fills the entire space with a given element.

=== Model ===

Filled Box's model must know what element is to be displayed.  We refer to this as its 'brush.'

  * `void set_brush(element const &brush)`
  * `element get_brush() const`

=== Theme ===

There are no thematic requirements for a Filled Box.
