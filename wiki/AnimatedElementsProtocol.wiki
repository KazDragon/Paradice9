#summary A protocol for producing animated images in Paradice

TODO: The protocol should involve:
  * A header stating:
    * The dimensions of the animated image
    * The looping characteristics of the image:
      * Whether it loops at all
      * From what frame the image loops.
      * NB: could be factored out into a generic "repeating block"
  * A series of frames containing:
    * Information about how long the frame remains shown
    * The actual image shown, using TextToElementsProtocol
